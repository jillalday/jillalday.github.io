<p class="text"> This is my first dive, After taking the e-learning class for the foundation of knowledge that I would need for the pool session, weeks came quickly and we were off to Florida. With COVID 19, masks were required on the flight and I was anxious because it was a full flight. Arrived at 8:32 pm in Orlando and the next day we took a 4 hours car ride to Key Largo Florida. At last, I saw the ocean a new sight on my eyes with a salty and fishy smell, it was refreshing. The next day, in the morning it was the pool session where fundamentals were taught, how to put together the equipment, how they are used and I had to swim 16 rounds around the pool to test if I really can swim with snorkels and fins. Then the moment where I need to go and breathe underwater and equalize. At first, it was uncomfortable because as a beginner I was thinking of so many things. Then all of the other lessons were taught but all I can remember is the feeling of me trying to breathe slowly. After the pool session, it was time to go out in the middle of the ocean and dive. Surprisingly, I could not tell if I was nervous but it was more exciting is than I felt at that moment. First, it was the debriefing of the boat crew with my instructor, then it was time to pick up my equipment and go in front of the boat. The regulator on my mouth, one hand in front of my mask, and the other at the back of it. I looked into the horizon, relaxed my body, shook off the stiffness of my limbs, closed my mind, let go of the fear. And took a big step forward and dove. As I descend 30 feet deep into the ocean, I am thinking of so many things. Trying to breathe slowly to conserve air. Trying to equalize. Trying to be buoyant. And especially trying to enjoy the actual dive and seeing the beautiful world around me. It is a different world down there. Peaceful, untouched, and no COVID. But you know there’s a certain peaceful feeling that comes from it once I’ve overcome that fear. After that, I did 4 more dives to finish my certification. And yes, thankfully I got certified. </p>
